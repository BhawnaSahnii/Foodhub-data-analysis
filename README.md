# FoodHub Data Analysis

An exploratory data analysis project for a food aggregator company to understand customer ordering behavior, restaurant demand, and cuisine preferences to improve customer experience and business operations.

## Project Overview

This project analyzes FoodHub's order data to extract actionable insights about customer preferences, restaurant performance, delivery times, and revenue patterns. The analysis helps the company make data-driven decisions to enhance their service and optimize operations.

## Business Problem

FoodHub is a food aggregator company that connects customers with various restaurants. To improve their business and customer experience, they need to understand:
- Which restaurants are most popular?
- What cuisines drive the most orders?
- How do delivery times vary?
- What factors influence customer ratings?
- When do peak ordering hours occur?

## Dataset

**File:** `foodhub_order.csv`

The dataset contains order-level information including:
- Order ID and customer ID
- Restaurant name and cuisine type
- Cost of the order
- Day of the week
- Rating provided by customers
- Food preparation time
- Delivery time

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Libraries:**
  - pandas - Data manipulation and analysis
  - numpy - Numerical computations
  - matplotlib - Data visualization
  - seaborn - Statistical data visualization
  - jupyter notebook - Interactive development environment

```

##  Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

### Running the Analysis

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BhawnaSahnii/Foodhub-data-analysis.git
cd Foodhub-data-analysis
```

2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

3. Open `Learner_Notebook_Full_Code.ipynb` and run all cells

## Analysis Approach

1. **Data Understanding**
   - Import and inspect the dataset
   - Check data types and missing values
   - Understand variable distributions

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Univariate analysis of key variables
   - Bivariate analysis to find relationships
   - Time-based analysis (day of week, ordering patterns)

3. **Key Insights**
   - Restaurant popularity and revenue analysis
   - Cuisine preference patterns
   - Delivery time analysis
   - Rating patterns and customer satisfaction
   - Cost distribution and spending behavior

4. **Recommendations**
   - Actionable business insights
   - Strategies to improve customer experience
   - Optimization opportunities

## Key Questions Answered

- What are the top-performing restaurants?
- Which cuisines are most popular among customers?
- How does order cost vary across different restaurants?
- What is the relationship between delivery time and ratings?
- Are there specific days with higher order volumes?
- What factors influence customer ratings?

## Learning Outcomes

- Conducting comprehensive exploratory data analysis
- Creating meaningful visualizations for business insights
- Statistical analysis of order and delivery patterns
- Translating data findings into business recommendations
- Working with real-world food delivery data
