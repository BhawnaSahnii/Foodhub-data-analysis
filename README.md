# FoodHub Data Analysis

An exploratory data analysis project for a food aggregator company to understand customer ordering behavior, restaurant demand, and cuisine preferences to improve customer experience and business operations.

## 📋 Project Overview

This project analyzes FoodHub's order data to extract actionable insights about customer preferences, restaurant performance, delivery times, and revenue patterns. The analysis helps the company make data-driven decisions to enhance their service and optimize operations.

The dataset contains order-level information including:
- Order ID and customer ID
- Restaurant name and cuisine type
- Cost of the order
- Day of the week
- Rating provided by customers
- Food preparation time
- Delivery time

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Libraries:**
  - pandas - Data manipulation and analysis
  - numpy - Numerical computations
  - matplotlib - Data visualization
  - seaborn - Statistical data visualization
  - jupyter notebook - Interactive development environment

## 🔍 Analysis Approach

1. **Data Understanding**
   - Import and inspect the dataset
   - Check data types and missing values
   - Understand variable distributions

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Univariate analysis of key variables
   - Bivariate analysis to find relationships
   - Time-based analysis (day of week, ordering patterns)

3. **Key Insights**
   - Restaurant popularity and revenue analysis
   - Cuisine preference patterns
   - Delivery time analysis
   - Rating patterns and customer satisfaction
   - Cost distribution and spending behavior

4. **Recommendations**
   - Actionable business insights
   - Strategies to improve customer experience
   - Optimization opportunities

## 📈 Key Questions Answered

- What are the top-performing restaurants?
- Which cuisines are most popular among customers?
- How does order cost vary across different restaurants?
- What is the relationship between delivery time and ratings?
- Are there specific days with higher order volumes?
- What factors influence customer ratings?
